# GVfs

GVfs is a userspace virtual filesystem implementation for GIO (a library
available in GLib). GVfs comes with a set of backends, including trash support,
SFTP, SMB, HTTP, DAV, and many others. GVfs also contains modules for GIO that
implement volume monitors and persistent metadata storage. There is also FUSE
support that provides limited access to the GVfs filesystems for applications
not using GIO.
