# GVfs :file_folder:

GVfs is a userspace virtual filesystem implementation for GIO (a library available in GLib). It provides an extensive set of backends, including support for trash, SFTP, SMB, HTTP, DAV, and more. GVfs also includes GIO modules that implement volume monitors and persistent metadata storage. In addition, there's FUSE support to allow limited access to GVfs filesystems for applications that don't use GIO.
