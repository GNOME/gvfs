/* DirWatch
 *
 * a directory watcher utility for use by the trash:/ backend.
 *
 * A DirWatch monitors a given directory for existence under a very
 * specific set of circumstances.  When the directory comes into
 * existence, the create() callback is invoked.  When the directory
 * stops existing the destroy() callback is invoked.  If the directory
 * initially exists, then create() is invoked before the call to
 * dir_watch_new() returns.
 *
 * The directory to watch is considered to exist only if it is a
 * directory (and not a symlink) and its parent directory also exists.
 * A topdir must be given, which is always assumed to "exist".
 *
 * For example, if '/mnt/disk/.Trash/1000/files/' is monitored with
 * '/mnt/disk/' as a topdir then the following conditions must be true
 * in order for the directory to be reported as existing:
 *
 *   /mnt/disk/ is blindly assumed to exist
 *   /mnt/disk/.Trash must be a directory (not a symlink)
 *   /mnt/disk/.Trash/1000 must be a directory (not a symlink)
 *   /mnt/disk/.Trash/1000/files must be a directory (not a symlink)
 *
 * If any of these ceases to be true (even momentarily), the directory
 * will be reported as having been destroyed.  create() and destroy()
 * callbacks are never issued spuriously (ie: two calls to one
 * callback will never occur in a row).  Events where the directory
 * exists momentarily might be missed, but events where the directory
 * stops existing momentarily will (hopefully) always be reported.
 * The first call (if it happens) will always be to create().
 *
 * check() is only ever called in response to a call to
 * dir_watch_check() in which case it will be called only if the
 * watched directory was marked as having existed before the check and
 * is found to still exist.  This facilitates the checking that has to
 * occur in that case (ie: check the contents of the directory to make
 * sure that they are also unchanged).
 *
 * This implementation is currently tweaked a bit for how GFileMonitor
 * currently works with inotify.  If GFileMonitor's implementation is
 * changed it might be a good idea to take another look at this code.
