/* decide_watch_type:
 *
 * This function is responsible for determining what sort of watching
 * we should do on a given mountpoint according to the type of
 * filesystem.  It must return one of the WatchType constants above.
 *
 *   TRASH_WATCHER_TRUSTED:
 *
 *     This is used for filesystems on which notification is supported
 *     and all file events are reliably reported.  After initialisation
 *     the trash directories are never manually rescanned since any
 *     changes are already known to us from the notifications we
 *     received about them (that's where the "trust" comes in).
 *
 *     This should be used for local filesystems such as ext3.
 *
 *   TRASH_WATCHER_WATCH:
 *
 *     This is used for filesystems on which notification is supported
 *     but works unreliably.  Some changes to the filesystem may not
 *     be delivered by the operating system.  The events which are
 *     delivered are immediately reported but events which are not
 *     delivered are not reported until the directory is manually
 *     rescanned (ie: trash_watcher_rescan() is called).
 *
 *     This should be used for filesystems like NFS where local
 *     changes are reported by the kernel but changes made on other
 *     hosts are not.
 *
 *   TRASH_WATCHER_NO_WATCH:
 *
 *     Don't bother watching at all.  No change events are ever
 *     delivered except while running trash_watcher_rescan().
 *
 *     This should be used for filesystems where change notification
 *     is unsupported or is supported, but buggy enough to cause
 *     problems when using the other two options.
